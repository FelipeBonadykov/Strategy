HISTORY
 The first version of the game was a paper-printed field and figures.
 I made a decision to write a Java game using all my knowledge in programming to improve and get some new skills.
 I spent a lot of time working on it. I was the leader, worker and employee at the same time. 
 The release date fell on December 24, 2017.
 CONTENT
 In menu you can choose on of three modes: 'player v. player', 'player v. computer' or 'online'. 
 The first one has not so strict rules. You can invent yours and implement them without any problems.
 The second one is less 'free'. You have to follow the given rules and you can't invent anything excepting the strategy.
 The third one has an extra feature - you can place your figure as you want at the beginning.
 But than you must press a little red button to limit your moves to those set in instructions
USED TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS
 I used Eclipse IDE, Windows 10 and Java SE8 (also Swing and AWT GUI)
 Lately I added online mode using google cloud.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Make sure you have java 8 or higher
2. Run jar file
3. If jar file doesn't work, run bat file
